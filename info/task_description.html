    Find the most crucial node in the network. Node's crucinesses is related to user's average satisfaction. If one user can send email to everybody else than his satisfaction is 100%. If the same user can mailing only with half of the network community than his total satisfaction is 50%. If user is on the crashed node he can't send email to anybody.
</p>

<p>
    You see. This is easy. Your mission here is to find out crushing of which node hurts total satisfaction the most.

    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. Network structure (as list of connections between nodes), users on each node (as dict where keys are node-name and values are amount of users).

    <strong>Output: </strong> List of the most crusial nodes.
